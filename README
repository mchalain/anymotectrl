AnymoteCtrl:
------------
AnymoteCtrl is a part of the Google-tv-remote daemon for Linux.
It parses and generates kernel event from "Anymote" (google) messages.
It reads messages from a fifo file or the standard input.
You need google-tv-pairing to manage network sub-system with device pairing and data receiving.

Building:
---------
Edit the main Makefile to change PREFIX, SHAREDIR, CONFIGDIR, BINDIR, LIBDIR
The default values are:
 PREFIX=/usr/local
 BINDIR=/usr/local/bin
 LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib
 SHAREDIR=/usr/local/share/anymote
 CONFIGDIR=/usr/local/etc/anymote

To build, launch:
 make
and as root:
 make install

To build a package with archiver:
 PACKAGEDIR=$(ARCHIVERDIR)/ make install

Install files:
--------------
different files are generated with specific use:
 - anymotecltrd: the main application. It reads the input fifo and push data in the librrary parser.
 - libanymotectlr.so: the library parser. It loads plugins, and parses data to generate events.
 - libdeviceadapter_kbd.so: the plugin that transforms Anymote data string to keycode.
 - defaultmap.bin: it describes the keyboard mapping. Change the value KEYMAP in the src/Makefile
 - libdeviceadapter_mouse.so: the plugin that transforms Anymote "mouseevent", "mousewheel" messages to mouse events.
 - libdeviceadapter_remote.so: the plugin that transforms Anymote "keyevent" messages to keycode.
 - remotemap.bin: it describes the keycode translation.
 - libdevicedriver_uinput.so: the plugin that push events in the kernel system with uinput kernel module.
